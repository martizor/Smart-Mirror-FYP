# Smart-Mirror-FYP


Welcome to by github page for my final year project. In this github respository is all the code that I have used to make 
my project. The code used is seperated in different folders. For instance the app, flask-webserver, ReactJS front-end, Tiny-Yolo architecture
and my Raspberry pi scripts are stored in their respective folders.
